=======================

User receive notifications when :
    - user starts to follow                         -> user_follower
#    - user starts to follow one board              -> board_follower
#    - followed user's board added a new pin        -> add_pin
#    - followed user added a new board              -> add_board
#    - pin has been repinned                        -> re_pinned
#    - user allowed you to see his private board    -> allow_read


To implement later :
    - pin has been liked                            -> pin_like

    - pin has been commented                        -> pin_comment
    - board has been commented                      -> board_comment
    - pin user commented received answer            -> pin_comment_answer
    - board user commented received answer          -> board_comment_answer


Add a new line in menu with link to user's notifications page, and number of notifications
