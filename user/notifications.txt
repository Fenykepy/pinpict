User receive notifications when :
     --- event ---                                  --- type ---        --- object ---
#    - user starts to follow                        -> user_follower    -> User
#    - user starts to follow one board              -> board_follower   -> Board 
#    - followed user's board added a new pin        -> add_pin          -> Pin
#    - followed user added a new board              -> add_board        -> Board
#    - pin has been repinned                        -> re_pinned        -> Pin
#    - user allowed you to see his private board    -> allow_read       -> Board


To implement later :
#    - pin has been liked                            -> pin_like         -> Pin
    - following liked pin                           -> following_liked_pin -> pin

    - pin has been commented                        -> pin_comment      -> Pin
    - board has been commented                      -> board_comment    -> Board
    - pin user commented received answer            -> pin_comment_answer   -> Pin
    - board user commented received answer          -> board_comment_answer -> Pin
